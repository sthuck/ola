The graphs in this directory are issued from the CMPLIB (2010) from the Optsicom Project (http://www.optsicom.es/cutwidth/)

You can download the full CutWidth Instances (CMPLIB) from http://www.optsicom.es/cutwidth/cwp-files/CMPLIB_2010.zip

We have converted the graphs of the “Small” subset of the CMPLIB to the edgelist format. Each line represents the endpoints of an edge.
